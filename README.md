This will give a clear understanding of what NumPy is and how it is being used in your project.
# NumPy Project

This project demonstrates the use of the **NumPy** library for numerical computations in Python. 

## NumPy Overview
NumPy is a powerful library for handling large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numeric data. It provides an extensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

NumPy is widely used in:
- Scientific computing
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
- Signal processing

Key features include:
- Efficient multi-dimensional array manipulation
- Support for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation
- Broadcasting, which allows operations between arrays of different shapes

## How NumPy is used in this project:
In this project, we use NumPy to:
- Create and manipulate arrays
- Perform mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and statistical calculations

### Example Code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2x2 matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Calculate the transpose of the matrix
transpose_matrix = np.transpose(matrix)

print("Original Matrix:\n", matrix)
print("Transpose Matrix:\n", transpose_matrix)
